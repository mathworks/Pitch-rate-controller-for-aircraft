Use this model of the de Havilland Beaver Airframe to follow along with "Trim, Linearization, and Control Design for an Aircraft" and learn about this linearization and control design workflow. The airframe takes in elevator, aileron, rudder, and throttle as inputs and outputs angles, angular rates, and position in the body coordinate frame. You will learn to linearize and design a controller for the airframe model in Simulink. The Model Linearizer makes it easy to trim and linearize around operating points. Once the aircraft has been linearized, the Control System Designer makes it convenient to design a Controller for a Single Input Single Output system using both graphical and automated tuning methods. The controller can then be exported back to Simulink, allowing for confirmation of design through simulation.

## Setup 
To Run:
1. open "dehavillandControl.slx"
2. select "run" from the toolstrip
